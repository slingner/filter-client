When you first open the web app and select All Beans from the navigation bar, you will see a list of coffee beans from around the world (each one as an individual card). While browsing, you will see a Flavor Filterm, which is set of checkboxes which will allow you to filter the list to based on the flavor profile you are interested in. An example of this filter is if a user selects FRUIT and CITRUS, the All Beans list will filter down to display all individual beans that have the FRUIT AND CITRUS flavor notes.

### Summary

FILTER gives you the opportunity to explore coffee beans that are responsibly sourced from crops around the world.

![Bean Closeup](README-asset/coffee4.jpg?raw=true)

When a user first opens FILTER, they will see a landing page giving examples and screenshots of FILTER's potential. After logging in, the user will be able to browse and filter through the coffee beans collection. The Flavor Filter(a set of flavor note checkboxes) will allow the user to filter the All Beans list based on the flavor they are interested in. An example of using this filter is if a user selects FRUIT and CITRUS, the All Beans list will filter down to display all individual beans that have the FRUIT and CITRUS flavor notes.

When browsing through the collection, explore each bean's Country of Origin, MASL(Meters Above Sea Level), Grower, Process and Flavor Notes.

![BeanCard](README-asset/BeanCard.png?raw=true)

Once logged in, a returning user will have the ability to save specific coffee bean cards from the main list to their account(Your Beans). Within their account, the user will have the ability to view and modify their list of saved coffee beans (delete cards, add new cards, and add personal notes).

![UserPage](README-asset/UserPage.png?raw=true)

This app will be useful to coffee lovers around the world. Having the ability to explore and save coffee beans that they'd like to try will be an educational and useful experience.

Filter is responsive to any screen size so you can explore your beans on the road!

## Technologies Used to Develop FILTER
React, Enzyme, Mocha, Chai, Node, Express, PostgreSQL.

-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

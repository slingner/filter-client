![Bean Closeup](README-asset/coffee4.jpg?raw=true)

When you first open the web app and select All Beans from the navigation bar, you will see a list of coffee beans from around the world (each one as an individual card). While browsing, you will see a Flavor Filter, which is set of checkboxes which will allow you to filter the list to based on the flavor profile you are interested in. An example of this filter is if a user selects FRUIT and CITRUS, the All Beans list will filter down to display all individual beans that have the FRUIT AND CITRUS flavor notes.

When browsing through the collection, explore each bean's Country of Origin, MASL(Meters Above Sea Level), Grower, Process and Flavor Notes.

The user then has the option to sign up to create a personal account: <br />

and then log in:
![LogIn](README-asset/LogIn.png?raw=true)

Once logged in, a returning user will have the ability to save specific coffee bean cards from the main list to their account(Your Beans). Within their account, the user will have the ability to view and modify their list of saved coffee beans (delete cards, add new cards, and add personal notes).

This app will be useful to coffee lovers around the world. Having the ability to explore and save coffee beans that they'd like to try will be an educational and useful experience.

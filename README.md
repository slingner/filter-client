### Summary

FILTER gives you the opportunity to explore coffee beans that are responsibly sourced from crops around the world.

![Bean Closeup](README-asset/coffee4.jpg?raw=true)

When a user first opens FILTER, they will see a landing page giving examples and screenshots of FILTER's potential. After logging in, the user will be able to browse and filter through the coffee beans collection. The Flavor Filter(a set of flavor note checkboxes) will allow the user to filter the All Beans list based on the flavor they are interested in. An example of using this filter is if a user selects FRUIT and CITRUS, the All Beans list will filter down to display all individual beans that have the FRUIT and CITRUS flavor notes.

When browsing through the collection, explore each bean's Country of Origin, MASL(Meters Above Sea Level), Grower, Process and Flavor Notes.

![BeanCard](README-asset/BeanCard.png?raw=true)

Once logged in, a returning user will have the ability to save specific coffee bean cards from the main list to their account(Your Beans). Within their account, the user will have the ability to view and modify their list of saved coffee beans (delete cards, add new cards, and add personal notes).

![UserPage](README-asset/UserPage.png?raw=true)

This app will be useful to coffee lovers around the world. Having the ability to explore and save coffee beans that they'd like to try will be an educational and useful experience.

Filter is responsive to any screen size so you can explore your beans on the go!
